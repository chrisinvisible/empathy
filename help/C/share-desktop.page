  <title>Share your desktop</title>

  <p>
    It is possible, with some of your contacts, to share your desktop with them, or to start
     using your contacts desktop. You can use
     this functionality to show your desktop to your contacts, to ask for help or to
     help your contacts resolve a problem.
  </p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>
      In order to be able to share your desktop or to remotely use your contacts desktop,
       it is necessary to have a remote desktop viewer application installed in your system.
    </p>
  </note>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>
        From the <gui>Contact List</gui> window, perform one of the following:
      </p>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            Select the contact you want to share your desktop with, and choose
             <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Contact</gui><gui>Share my desktop</gui></guiseq>.
          </p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            Right-click on the name of the contact you want to share your desktop with,
             and select <gui>Share my desktop</gui>.
          </p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        A request will be sent to the contact you want to share your desktop with.
         If they accept, the default remote desktop viewer application will be launched in
         order to permit you to disconnect the user that is controlling your desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about how to use the remote desktop viewer application,
         refer to its help.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>
    When you share your desktop with someone else, it is possible to experience
     system performance slowdown and low Internet speed.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
      Not all your contacts might be able to support this functionality. It is necessary
       for them to have at least the 2.28 version of <app>Empathy</app> and a remote desktop
       viewer application installed in their system.
    </p>
